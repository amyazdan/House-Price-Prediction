# House Price Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle ([Bengaluru House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)) and employs data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, and linear regression modeling techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and dropping unnecessary features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming data.
- **Outlier Removal**: Eliminating outliers using business logic and statistical methods.
- **Model Building**: Training a linear regression model for price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.
- **Exporting the Model**: Saving the trained model for future use.
- **Deployment**: Providing a script for predicting house prices using the deployed model.
